2.⁠ ⁠Write reliable tests for React components\
3.⁠ ⁠⁠⁠Use AI to write the tests\
4.⁠ ⁠⁠Prompt AI to produce consistent tests

## Prior Works

- [Example of a proper testing infrastructure](https://github.com/zainfathoni/senar.ai)
- [GitHub Issue for previous talks](https://github.com/zainfathoni/senar.ai/issues/2)
- [Slides of writing reliable tests](https://github.com/zainfathoni/confident-react-testing)

## Todo

- [x] Initialize the talk slides using
      [Code Surfer](https://codesurfer.pomb.us/)
- [ ] Prepare the demo app with a simple component rendered in the browser
  - Use this repository as an example: <https://github.com/pomber/react-conf-2018-hooks-demo>
- [ ] Write the slides based on the talking points
  - [ ] 1. Prepare React Testing Infrastructure
  - [ ] 2. Write reliable tests for React components
  - [ ] 3. Use AI to write the tests
  - [ ] 4. Prompt AI to produce consistent tests
- [ ] Prepare the testing infrastructure demo app with
      [Vitest Browser Mode](https://vitest.dev/guide/browser/)
- [ ] Prepare the AI prompts to write the tests reliably under `docs/test-plans`
      directory
